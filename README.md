# AutoClicker
This is an autoclicker written in python, it's meant to be hard to find during a ScreenShare, this is the first version so I can't guarantee anything, and the clicker isn't meant to bypass anti-cheats so be careful.

# Instruction
Run the python script and press the "-" key for start the clicks, the key for stop the clicking is the same.
